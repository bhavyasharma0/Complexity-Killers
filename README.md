# Complexity-Killers

Our team — Ujjwal Bajpai (23204152), Kartik Saraswat (23207150), Aryaman Tyagi (23206412), and Bhavya Sharma (23200418) — will all contribute collaboratively to every stage of the project, including understanding the ARU-Counting-Sort algorithm, implementing it in Java, evaluating its performance, and presenting our results. However, the following members will take the lead in specific roles to streamline responsibilities and ensure accountability:

Developer (Lead: Ujjwal Bajpai)

Responsibilities:
Lead the implementation of the ARU-Counting-Sort algorithm in Java.
Set up the main structure of the codebase and manage integration of different components.
Ensure accurate translation of the pseudocode and oversee debugging and testing.
Supporting Developers: Kartik Saraswat, Aryaman Tyagi
Contribute to writing functions, refining logic, and performance optimization.

Analyser (Lead: Kartik Saraswat)

Responsibilities:
Evaluate the algorithm's performance against the baseline Counting-Sort and other comparators like QuickSort.
Generate or use datasets aligned with the original paper’s evaluation.
Document key findings and performance metrics.
Supporting Analysers: Bhavya Sharma, Ujjwal Bajpai

Communicator (Lead: Aryaman Tyagi)

Responsibilities:
Coordinate team meetings and progress check-ins.
Act as point of contact for communicating with instructors or TAs.
Ensure deadlines are tracked and responsibilities are well-communicated within the team.
Supporting Communicator: Bhavya Sharma

Documenter (Lead: Bhavya Sharma)

Responsibilities:
Lead the writing of the final report and README documentation.
Ensure the implementation is well-commented and aligns with the documented methodology.
Design and compile the poster for the final presentation.
Supporting Documents: Kartik Saraswat, Aryaman Tyagi
Our team will hold regular meetings and use GitHub for collaboration and version control, ensuring consistent progress and smooth integration of all deliverables.
Supporting Developer : Assist the Lead Developer in recreating the test environment and creating the logic and implementation of the sorting algorithm and focus on testing the algorithm.
